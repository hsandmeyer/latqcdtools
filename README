Description:
  This is a collection of tools that can be used for data analysis. Most tools are written in python.
  There is a very flexible jackknife routine, that can handle arbitrary functions in jackknife.py. The same holds
  for a bootstrap routine.
  A fitting routine including correlated fits can be found in fitting.py and corr_fitting.py

Please have a look into testing/ to see what is available and how it is used

Installation:
  To run those programs you need to have python3 somewhere in your $PATH.
  Additionally you have to define the environment variable PYTHONPATH containing the path
  to the root folder of this project.
  e.g. put

    export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/your/AnalysisToolBox/"

  into your .bashrc.

  I tested with python3.6 and above, I do not know whether lower versions work as well.
